control flow :--

# conditional statement
 eg :-

fn main(){
 let a = 2;
let b = 4;
let max = if a>b {'a'} else {'b'} ;
println!("Maximum of a and b is {max}");
if a>b {
println!(" a is greater than b");
} else {
println!(" b is greater than a");
}
}

Output :--
Maximum of a and b is b
b is greater than a


#Repitition using loops

--> Rust has 3 kinds of loops : loop , for , while

eg: -- 
//loop example
fn main(){
loop{
println!("How are U");
}
}
//loop will continue to print the statement until process is interupted

//Returning values from loops
fn main(){
let no = 5 ;
let i = 1;
let result = 1;
let fact = loop {
	if result > 5 {
		break	i ;
	}
	i *= result ;
	result++;
} ;
println!(" factorial of {} is {}",no , i);
}

// We can use loop labels to distinguish between loops 

'counter_loop : loop {
	.
	.
	.
	.
	loop {
		.
		.
		.
		if condition {
			break 'counter_loop;
			}
		}
}


// for , while work the same way as they work in other languages

// .rev() method which reverses the range
